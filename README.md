# terraform-azurerm-avm-template

This is a template repo for Terraform Azure Verified Modules.

Things to do:

1. Set up a GitHub repo environment called `test`.
1. Configure environment protection rule to ensure that approval is required before deploying to this environment.
1. Create a user-assigned managed identity in your test subscription.
1. Create a role assignment for the managed identity on your test subscription, use the minimum required role.
1. Configure federated identity credentials on the user assigned managed identity. Use the GitHub environment.
1. Search and update TODOs within the code and remove the TODO comments once complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
>
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
>
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Required Inputs

No required inputs.

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_availability_zones_filter"></a> [availability\_zones\_filter](#input\_availability\_zones\_filter)

Description: If true, the module will only return regions that have availability zones.

Type: `bool`

Default: `false`

### <a name="input_enable_telemetry"></a> [enable\_telemetry](#input\_enable\_telemetry)

Description: This variable controls whether or not telemetry is enabled for the module.  
For more information see https://aka.ms/avm/telemetryinfo.  
If it is set to false, then no telemetry will be collected.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

### <a name="input_geography_filter"></a> [geography\_filter](#input\_geography\_filter)

Description: If set, the module will only return regions that match the specified geography.

Type: `string`

Default: `null`

### <a name="input_geography_group_filter"></a> [geography\_group\_filter](#input\_geography\_group\_filter)

Description: If set, the module will only return regions that match the specified geography group.

Type: `string`

Default: `null`

### <a name="input_recommended_filter"></a> [recommended\_filter](#input\_recommended\_filter)

Description: If true, the module will only return regions that are have the category set to `Recommended` by the locations API.  
This is default `true` as several regions are not available for general deployment and must be explicitly made available via support ticket.  
Enabling these regions by default may lead to deployment failures.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

### <a name="input_use_cached_data"></a> [use\_cached\_data](#input\_use\_cached\_data)

Description: If true, the module will use cached data from the data directory. If false, the module will use live data from the Azure API.

The default is true to avoid unnecessary API calls and provide a guaranteed consistent output.  
Set to false to ensure the latest data is used.

Using data from the Azure APIs means that if the API response changes, then the module output will change.  
This may affect deployed resources that rely on this data.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### <a name="output_regions"></a> [regions](#output\_regions)

Description: A list of region objects subject to the filters supplied by input variables. Each region object contains the following attributes:

- `name` - The name of the region.
- `display_name` - The display name of the region.
- `paired_region_name` - The name of the region paired with this region. May be `null` if the region has no pair.
- `geography` - The geography of the region.
- `geography_group` - The geography group of the region.
- `zones` - A list of the availability zones in the region. Will be empty if the region does not support zones.

### <a name="output_regions_by_display_name"></a> [regions\_by\_display\_name](#output\_regions\_by\_display\_name)

Description: A map of region display names to region objects subject to the filters supplied by input variables. See `regions` output for more details.

### <a name="output_regions_by_geography"></a> [regions\_by\_geography](#output\_regions\_by\_geography)

Description: A map of geographies to a list of region objects subject to the filters supplied by input variables. See `regions` output for more details.

### <a name="output_regions_by_geography_group"></a> [regions\_by\_geography\_group](#output\_regions\_by\_geography\_group)

Description: A map of geography groups to a list of region objects subject to the filters supplied by input variables. See `regions` output for more details.

### <a name="output_regions_by_name"></a> [regions\_by\_name](#output\_regions\_by\_name)

Description: A map of region display names to region objects subject to the filters supplied by input variables. See `regions` output for more details.

Description: A set of valid region display names subject to the filters supplied by input variables.

### <a name="output_valid_region_names"></a> [valid\_region\_names](#output\_valid\_region\_names)
